This is an implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) project, written in [Crystal lang](https://crystal-lang.org/).
Under the hood, I've used [num.cr](https://crystal-data.github.io/num.cr/) for matrix operations, though there is not 100% equivalence with numpy/torch so I've had to do things a little differently in places.
